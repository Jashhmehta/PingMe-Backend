# PingME - A chat application

PingME is a feature-rich, real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.io. This application allows users to connect with friends, engage in conversations, and share multimedia content seamlessly. It is designed to offer a user-friendly interface and smooth experience for both individual and group chats.




## Features

- Real-Time Messaging: PingME enables users to send and receive messages instantly, ensuring that conversations are always up-to-date without needing to refresh the page. This is powered by Socket.io, which handles real-time communication between clients and the server.

- Friend Requests: Users can search for and send friend requests to other users. Once a friend request is accepted, the users can start chatting with each other. This feature helps in building and managing a personal network within the app.

 - Multimedia Sharing: Users can enhance their conversations by sharing photos, videos, and audio messages. This feature allows for richer interactions and makes the chat experience more engaging.

- Group Chats: PingME supports group chat functionality, where users can create groups, add or remove members, and manage group settings. This is particularly useful for team communications, family chats, or any group-based interactions.
